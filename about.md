Hello! My name is Savannah Million and this is my website! I'm a product designer/developer working remotely for [Iridescent](). I primarily design for [Curiosity Machine](), a program that provides children with STEM-inspired design challenges that they can build at home, with access to professional engineers who help them learn.<br/><br/>

I live in Chicago with my cat Pye and I ride a shiny bike with a shiny helmet.<br/><br/>

You can get in touch with me through email, [sav@nnah.rocks](mailto:'sav@nnah.rocks') or through twitter, [@savannahmillion](https://twitter.com/savannahmillion).
